# Active Tasks

Current work in progress.

## Current Status

**Active**: None.

Last completed: **Native release notifications** (2026-06-24, `chore/publish-native-notify`) — `publish.yml` publishes a GitHub Release on success (emails watchers); native Actions emails on failure; no secrets. See `.ai/tasks/completed.md`.

**Owner one-time action**: set repo **Watch → Custom → Releases** so the success emails arrive.

**Watching**: next NordVPN release — the daily checker auto-builds/tests a dev image and opens a draft PR.

## Blocked Candidates

## Ready Follow-Ups

### Watch for NordVPN 4.6.x release

**Status**: Waiting (no action needed — weekly GitHub Action handles detection)
**Goal**: Bump to the next NordVPN version when available

**When triggered**:
- GitHub Actions opens a draft PR automatically on Monday, OR
- Run `task check-version` to check manually

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Draft PR reviewed: confirm NORDVPN_VERSION and IMAGE_VERSION
- [ ] PR merged
- [ ] `git pull` locally
- [ ] `task docker-build` succeeds
- [ ] `task verify` passes all 4 checks
- [ ] `task release` runs cleanly (tag created and pushed)
- [ ] GitHub publish workflow completes; image appears on Docker Hub
- [ ] `.ai/current.md` updated with new versions and date
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` pinned version block updated

### README.md rewrite (Tier 3 — deferred, not yet approved)

**Status**: Deferred
**Goal**: Replace the upstream `bubuntux/nordvpn` mirror with a project-specific README
**Note**: `docs/user-guide.md` content feeds this when approved
